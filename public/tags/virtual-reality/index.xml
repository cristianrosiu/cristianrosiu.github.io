    <description><![CDATA[<p>Rendering accurate water reflections is crucial for achieving realism in computer graphics. Their integration with VR and AR technologies can further elevate experiences in sectors like education, engineering, and medicine.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-paperhttpsrepositorytudelftnlrecorduuid6a14ca81-a277-4a1b-b45f-b6ac50b45045">Abstract (<a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:6a14ca81-a277-4a1b-b45f-b6ac50b45045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Paper</a>)</h3>
<p>Even though various monoscopic reflection techniques exist they either demand substantial computational resources or cannot be straightforwardly adapted to stereoscopic media, leaving a big hole in research concerning stereo-aware reflections and their applications. This thesis researches and analyses the different techniques for water reflections. Further, it makes significant strides in the development of stereo-consistent real-time water reflections for XR platforms. This is achieved by combining implicit functions and bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) into a unified system called Adaptive Hierarchical Signed Distance Fields Reflections (AH-SDFR). It was found that AH-SDF outperforms leading methods such as Hierarchical Screen Space Reflections (HSSR) and Reflection Probes in both visual quality and performance, and as a result, it offers a promising solution for XR applications. However, challenges persist, mainly due to the large memory demands of intricate 3D scenes and perceptual errors from inaccuracies in volume textures.</p>]]></description>
