### Abstract ([Paper](https://github.com/cristianrosiu/mathisfactory/blob/main/report.pdf))

By utilizing AR technology, the game provides an interactive and immersive learning experience for students, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The game is set in a geological context, with players analyzing and predicting lava flow in a volcanic situation using their understanding of level curves and directional derivatives.
